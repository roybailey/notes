# AWS Notes

* Region = area of world with 2+ Availability Zones
* Availability Zone = Data Centre (or Data Centres that are too close to be considered alternative failover DC)
* Edge Location = Caching content; Content Delivery Network (CDN) e.g. CloudFront
* A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) = virtual network dedicated to a single AWS account. Logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS cloud, providing compute resources with security and robust networking functionality.
